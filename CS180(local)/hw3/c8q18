C8Q18:

Firstly, Decisive Subset Problem is in NP:

If we were given a decisive set, we can check the answer in polynomial time by doing the following.
Check the size of decisive set is at most k.
For each issue, check if the decision of the decisive set is the same as the decision of the entire committee. 
If for every issue, the answer is yes, then the given dicisive set is valid. Else, it is invalid. 

Next, we want to prove DSP is NP-Complete:

Let's focus on reducing Set Cover to DSP. 
For each point in the Set Cover, p(i), it represents the committee's decision on issue(i, result). 
According to the example given, we will have three points representing issue(1, yes), issue(2, no) and issue(3, yes). 
The sets in Set Cover will include each member's correct decisions. 
That means, 
Set m1 will contain (issue1, issue3), since m1 is correct about these 2 issue.
Set m2 will contain (issue1, issue2).
Set m3 will contain (issue2, issue3).
Set m4 will contain (issue3). 
If we can find a decisive set of size at most k, then its coresponding sets will be the answer for Set Cover.
