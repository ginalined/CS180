C8Q36:

First, Daily Special Scheduling Problem is in NP:

Given an order of making the k daily specials, we can check that the amount of money spent on buying the ingredients is greater or smaller than x in polynomial time. 

Next, we want to prove that Hamiltonian Path reduces to DSSP:

Suppose we have a directed graph G with n nodes and m edges. Each node represents a daily special. And each egde represents an ingredient. Each special requires one unit of each ingredients. 
Then, there is a Hamiltonian path in G if and only if there is a way to schedule all specials at a cost of 2m-(n-1). We can save money on the n-1 ingredients that correspond to edges on the path.
