C5Q3:

Firstly, distribute each card to be in one set S respectively, so there's total n sets, with each set Si having one card Ci.
Associate each set S with a count, which is the number of cards it has. Initially, all sets have a count value of 1.
Also associate each set with a bankAccount, this is the bankAccount the cards in the set corresponding to. 

Pass in the set of S into following function.

collectionOfS Function(S1, ..., Sn) {
	If (only two sets passed in as inputs)
		If (bankAccount of S1 == bankAccount of S2)
			S1.count += S2.count
			Remove S2 from collectionOfS
			return collectionOfS
	Else
		firstHalf = Function(S1, ..., S(n/2))
		secondHalf = Function((n/2+1), ..., Sn)
		retSet = Function(firstHalf, secondHalf)
		return retSet
}

Loop through the retSet
	If any Si in retSet has count > n/2
		YES
	Else
		NO
