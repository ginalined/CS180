C5Q5:

Recursive function:
------
Maintain a set of visibleLines(L1, ..., Ln) and initially set it to NULL set.
Label the lines according to increasing gradient a(i). 
If n == 3, add L1 and L3 to visibleLines.
	If L2 meets the L1 at x1 and meets L3 at x2 and x1 >= x2
		add L2 to visibleLines
Return visibleLines
------
Divide the input array into two halfs: LEFT and RIGHT.
visibleLeft = Call Recursive function on LEFT.
visibleRight = Call Recursive function on RIGHT. 
Merge visibleLeft with visibleRight with increasing gradient. 
Call Recursive function on merged(visibleLeft, visibleRight) and return it.
