C7Q17:

Assume that there are total m possible paths from s to t in the undestroyed network, where m >= k. 
Keep a set of reachableNodes from s and initilize it to empty set. 

Select any path from the m possible paths. Let it be P. 
	ping(midpoint of P). 
	If reports that no path currently exists,
		Break out of the loop when P lefts with 1 node.
		Let P = starting node of P to midpoint of P. 
		Go to line 11.
	Else if reports a path or multiple paths from s to the point,
		Record down the paths by adding all the nodes along the paths into reachableNodes.
		Break out of the loop when P lefts with 1 node.
		Let P = midpoint of P to ending node of P.
		Go to line 11. 
	Go to line 10 with another possible paths.
	Break out of the loop after k times. 
Return (V - reachableNodes - s - t).

Runtime:
Since we are doing binary search for k iterations, runtime will be k(logn).
