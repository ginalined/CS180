C7Q29:

This problem can be solved using min-cut method.
To start, let's create an undirected graph G(V,E), with the vertices representing software applications.
Let's call them V1, V2, ..., Vn, where Vi corresponds to application i. 
There is a special vertex t. 
If applications i and j have an associated value Xij, then we have an edge between Vi and Vj of capacity Xij. 
For every vertex Vi, i != 1, we have an edge (Vi, t) of capacity b(Vi).
We can say that V1 - t min-cut will give desired answer. 
Let X be such a cut. 
So, V1 is in X and t is not in X. 
Capacity of X = sum of Xij (for Vi,Vj in X) - sum of b(Vi) (for Vi not in X) + sum of b(V). 
This is same as expense minus benefit of moving applications which are not in set X.
Thus, finding a mincut is same as finding the set of applications for which expense minus benefit is minimized or benefit minus expense is maximized.
