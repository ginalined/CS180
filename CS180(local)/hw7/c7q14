C7Q14:

(a) 
We can convert the graph G into a maxflow graph G' and then run the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm on the G'. 

Here's how to do the conversion:
Create two nodes, source s and sink t. 
Assign directed edges from s to every node in X with the capacity of 1. 
For every edges originally in G, we assign them a capacity of 1 too. 
We also assign each nodes in S an edge to t with a capacity of |X|. 
//|X| = # of nodes in X. 

There exist an evacuation route if and only if the maximum flow of G' equals to sum of the capacity of the edges out of source, s. 
This algorithm will have the runtime of Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm, which is polynomial. 

(b)
For each node N (exclude s and t), turn them into two nodes, N1 and N2, with a directed edge between them, and assign the edge with capacity of 1.

N 
becomes
N1 --> N2

In this case, if any nodes was visited more than once, the maximum flow of G' will be smaller than the capacity of the edges out of s. 

Example:
















Blue nodes = X, Black nodes = S.
