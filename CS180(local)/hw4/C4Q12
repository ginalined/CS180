C4Q12:

(a) The claim is FALSE.
	Counter-example:
	(b1, t1) = (10, 1) and (b2, t2) = (50, 1), and suppose r = 40.
	There exist a valid schedule (s1, s2) even when s2 does not satisfies the claim, 
	because (50 !<= 40 * 1). 

(b) Sort the streams in increasing order of b(i)/t(i)	//main factor that affects runtime
	Initially, btotal = 0 and ttotal = 0
	from i = 0 to i = n
		btotal += b(i)
		ttotal += t(i)
	if btotal / ttotal <= r
		there exists a valid schedule
	else 
		there does not exist a valid schedule

	Runtime: O(n^2)

	Proof:
	Since we rearranged the streams in increasing order of b(i)/t(i), 
	as i increases, the value of b(i)/t(i) will only increase. 
	So when i == n, the value of b(i)/t(i) reaches maximum. 
	And if this maximum is still smaller than the parameter r, 
	that means all the previous instance will be smaller than r.
